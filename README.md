* Working on Markdowns
* Still learning the terminal!

## What I've Learned:

**Coding is both difficult *and* easy**

1. Keep trying.
1. Work through it.
1. Eventually you will understand.

### Some code examples:

```javascript
function myCat (old) {
    if (old) {
        return 'Feed the kitty!'}
        else {
            return 'Let it outside.'};
        }
    }
}
```
Feed the old cat!

#### And now for a table!
